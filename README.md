Fan-made Pacman game. 

I only learnt Python this summer, and consequently there are still differences between this version of Pacman and the true version that are yet to be smoothed out, and a possibility of bugs/glitches.

Note:
Due to the way that Pacman logic detects collisions (I have coded true to the original's logic), there is a very small chance that the ghosts and Pacman may pass through one another without interacting! This, interestingly, was a feature of the original game!

Differences to original game/things I am yet to add:

A functioning scoreboard so that high scores and player names may be saved. This is in the works, and some of the modules I have written for this have been uploaded, despite not yet being used in game.

Bonus items like cherries, starberries etc which give the players extra points.

Additional sound affects like background game music.

A proper death annimation and game over screen for the game.

Ghosts currently don't go slower in tunnels, as in the original game.

In the original game, some special squares limited the ghosts movement options. I havent yet coded these in, but the casual player will not know the difference anyway.

Game doesn't briefly slow down as you eat a ghost, as was in the original.

Energiser tablet times do not yet change with level.
